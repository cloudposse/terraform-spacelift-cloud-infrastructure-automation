[![Terraform Open Source Modules](https://docs.cloudposse.com/images/terraform-open-source-modules.svg)][terraform_modules]



It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).







We literally have [*hundreds of terraform modules*][terraform_modules] that are Open Source and well-maintained. Check them out!







## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-spacelift-cloud-infrastructure-automation/releases).


Here's how to invoke this module in your project

```hcl
provider "spacelift" {}

module "example" {
  source = "https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-spacelift-cloud-infrastructure-automation.git?ref=master"

  config_file_path = "config""
  branch           = "main"
  repository       = "my-infra-repo"
}
```




## Examples

Here is an example of using this module:
- [`examples/complete`](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-spacelift-cloud-infrastructure-automation/) - complete example of using this module

We use YAML for the configuration files in order to separate configuration settings from business logic. It's also a portable format that can be used across multiple tools. Our convention is to name files by `$env-$stage.yaml` (e.g. `ue2-testing.yaml`), so for example an `$env` could be `ue2` (for `us-east-2`) and the `$stage` might be `testing`. Workspace names are derived from the `$env-$stage-$project`, which looks like  `ue2-testing-eks`.

```yaml
# Projects are all the top-level root modules
projects:
  # Globals are exported as TF_VAR_... environment variables in every workspace
  globals:
    # Used to determine the name of the workspace (e.g. the 'testing' in 'ue2-testing')
    stage: testing
    # Used to determine the name of the workspace (e.g. the 'ue2' in 'ue2-testing')
    environment: ue2
  # The configuration file format is designed to be used across multiple tools.
  # All terraform projects should be listed under this section.
  terraform:
    # List one or more Terraform projects here
    first-project:
      # Controls whether or not this workspace should be created
      # NOTE: If set to 'false', you cannot reference this workspace via `triggers` in another workspace!
      workspace_enabled: true
      # Override the version of Terraform for this workspace (defaults to the latest in Spacelift)
      terraform_version: 0.13.4
      # Controls the `auto_apply` setting within this workspace
      auto_apply: true
      # Add extra 'Run Triggers' to this workspace, beyond the parent workspace, which is created by default
      # These triggers mean this project workspace will be automatically planned if any of these workspaces are applied.
      triggers:
        - uw2-testing-example2
        - gbl-root-example1
      # Set the Terraform input variable values for this project. Complex types like maps and lists are supported.
      vars:
        my_input_var: "Hello world! This is a value that needs to be passed to my `first-project` Terraform project."
    # Every project should be uniquely named and correspond to a folder in the `projects/` directory
    second-project:
      workspace_enabled: true
      # Specify a custom project folder (defalts to the project name if not specified)
      custom_project_folder: my-custom-project-folder
      vars:
        my_input_var: "Hello world! This is another example!"
```

Additionally, you must have a `globals.yaml` present in the `config` folder, which contains environment variables that will be applied to all stacks.
