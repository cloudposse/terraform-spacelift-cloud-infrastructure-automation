# Short description of this project
description: |-
  This project provides all the scaffolding for a typical well-built Cloud Posse module. It's a template repository you can
  use when creating new repositories.

# Introduction to the project
#introduction: |-
#  This is an introduction.

# How to use this module. Should be an easy example to copy and paste.

### TODO - We need to add more info/examples here on how to setup the top-level project in Spacelift!
#
# - Add some prerequisite info & links about provisioning the Spacelift account
# - Should we include the environment-level trigger policy in this module?
# - What else?
#
usage: |-
  Here's how to invoke this module in your project:

  ```hcl
  provider "spacelift" {}

  module "example" {
    source = "https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-spacelift-cloud-infrastructure-automation.git?ref=master"

    config_file_path = "config""
    branch           = "main"
    repository       = "my-infra-repo"
  }
  ```

# Example usage
examples: |-
  Here is an example of using this module:
  - [`examples/complete`](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-spacelift-cloud-infrastructure-automation/) - complete example of using this module

  We use YAML for the configuration files in order to separate configuration settings from business logic. It's also a portable format that can be used across multiple tools. Our convention is to name files by `$env-$stage.yaml` (e.g. `ue2-testing.yaml`), so for example an `$env` could be `ue2` (for `us-east-2`) and the `$stage` might be `testing`. Workspace names are derived from the `$env-$stage-$component`, which looks like  `ue2-testing-eks`.

  ```yaml
  # Components are all the top-level root modules
  components:
    # Globals are exported as TF_VAR_... environment variables in every workspace
    globals:
      # Used to determine the name of the workspace (e.g. the 'testing' in 'ue2-testing')
      stage: testing
      # Used to determine the name of the workspace (e.g. the 'ue2' in 'ue2-testing')
      environment: ue2
    # The configuration file format is designed to be used across multiple tools.
    # All terraform components should be listed under this section.
    terraform:
      # List one or more Terraform components here
      first-component:
        # Controls whether or not this workspace should be created
        # NOTE: If set to 'false', you cannot reference this workspace via `triggers` in another workspace!
        workspace_enabled: true
        # Override the version of Terraform for this workspace (defaults to the latest in Spacelift)
        terraform_version: 0.13.4
        # Controls the `auto_apply` setting within this workspace
        auto_apply: true
        # Add extra 'Run Triggers' to this workspace, beyond the parent workspace, which is created by default
        # These triggers mean this component workspace will be automatically planned if any of these workspaces are applied.
        triggers:
          - uw2-testing-example2
          - gbl-root-example1
        # Set the Terraform input variable values for this component. Complex types like maps and lists are supported.
        vars:
          my_input_var: "Hello world! This is a value that needs to be passed to my `first-component` Terraform component."
      # Every component should be uniquely named and correspond to a folder in the `components/` directory
      second-component:
        workspace_enabled: true
        # Specify a custom component folder (defalts to the component name if not specified)
        custom_component_folder: my-custom-component-folder
        vars:
          my_input_var: "Hello world! This is another example!"
  ```

  Additionally, you must have a `globals.yaml` present in the `config` folder, which contains environment variables that will be applied to all stacks.
