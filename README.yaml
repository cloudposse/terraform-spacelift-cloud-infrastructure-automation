# Short description of this project
description: |-
  Terraform module to provision [Spacelift](https://spacelift.io/) resources for cloud infrastructure automation.

# Introduction to the project
#introduction: |-
#  This is an introduction.

# How to use this module. Should be an easy example to copy and paste.

usage: |-

  The first step is to create a new infrastructure repository in GitHub and link it in Spacelift. You will want the `Project root`
  of the infrastructure repository to point to the `top-level` project that contains the reference to this module. Beyond that,
  you will also want to enable the `Administrative` and `Autodeploy` options in the configuration.

  The `Administrative` option allows the top-level project and this module to create all other required configurations, such as stacks,
  policies, and contexts.

  Once you have the top-level project configured and ready, simply trigger it manually, or by pushing an update to the infrastructure
  to Git.

  Here's how to invoke this module in your project:

  ```hcl
  provider "spacelift" {}

  module "spacelift" {
    source  = "cloudposse/cloud-infrastructure-automation/spacelift"
    # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
    # version     = "x.x.x"

    stack_config_path_template = var.stack_config_path_template
    components_path            = var.spacelift_component_path

    branch                = "main"
    repository            = var.git_repository
    commit_sha            = var.git_commit_sha
    spacelift_run_enabled = false
    runner_image          = var.runner_image
    worker_pool_id        = var.worker_pool_id
    autodeploy            = var.autodeploy
    manage_state          = false

    terraform_version     = var.terraform_version
    terraform_version_map = var.terraform_version_map

    imports_processing_enabled        = false
    stack_deps_processing_enabled     = false
    component_deps_processing_enabled = true

    policies_available     = var.policies_available
    policies_enabled       = var.policies_enabled
    policies_by_id_enabled = []
    policies_by_name_path  = format("%s/rego-policies", path.module)

    administrative_stack_drift_detection_enabled   = true
    administrative_stack_drift_detection_reconcile = true
    administrative_stack_drift_detection_schedule  = ["0 4 * * *"]

    drift_detection_enabled   = true
    drift_detection_reconcile = true
    drift_detection_schedule  = ["0 4 * * *"]

    aws_role_enabled                        = false
    aws_role_arn                            = null
    aws_role_external_id                    = null
    aws_role_generate_credentials_in_worker = false

    stack_destructor_enabled = false
  }
  ```

  **IMPORTANT:** Be sure to set the `manage_state` value from the start, otherwise changing this value after deploying a stack may cause resources to be orphaned!

# Example usage
examples: |-
  Here is an example of using this module:
  - [`examples/complete`](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-spacelift-cloud-infrastructure-automation/) - complete example of using this module

  We use YAML for the configuration files in order to separate configuration settings from business logic. It's also a portable format that can be used across multiple tools. Our convention is to name files by `$env-$stage.yaml` (e.g. `ue2-testing.yaml`), so for example an `$env` could be `ue2` (for `us-east-2`) and the `$stage` might be `testing`. Workspace names are derived from the `$env-$stage-$component`, which looks like  `ue2-testing-eks`.

  ```yaml
  # Components are all the top-level root modules
  components:
    # Globals are exported as TF_VAR_... environment variables in every workspace
    globals:
      # Used to determine the name of the workspace (e.g. the 'testing' in 'ue2-testing')
      stage: testing
      # Used to determine the name of the workspace (e.g. the 'ue2' in 'ue2-testing')
      environment: ue2
    # The configuration file format is designed to be used across multiple tools.
    # All terraform components should be listed under this section.
    terraform:
      # List one or more Terraform components here
      first-component:
        # Controls whether or not this workspace should be created
        # NOTE: If set to 'false', you cannot reference this workspace via `triggers` in another workspace!
        workspace_enabled: true
        # Override the version of Terraform for this workspace (defaults to the latest in Spacelift)
        terraform_version: 0.13.4
        # Controls the `auto_apply` setting within this workspace
        auto_apply: true
        # Add extra 'Run Triggers' to this workspace, beyond the parent workspace, which is created by default
        # These triggers mean this component workspace will be automatically planned if any of these workspaces are applied.
        triggers:
          - uw2-testing-example2
          - gbl-root-example1
        # Set the Terraform input variable values for this component. Complex types like maps and lists are supported.
        vars:
          my_input_var: "Hello world! This is a value that needs to be passed to my `first-component` Terraform component."
      # Every component should be uniquely named and correspond to a folder in the `components/` directory
      second-component:
        workspace_enabled: true
        # Specify a custom component folder (defalts to the component name if not specified)
        custom_component_folder: my-custom-component-folder
        vars:
          my_input_var: "Hello world! This is another example!"
  ```

  Additionally, you must have a `globals.yaml` present in the `config` folder, which contains environment variables that will be applied to all stacks.
