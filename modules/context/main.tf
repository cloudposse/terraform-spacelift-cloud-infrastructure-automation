# This is an envioronment variable defined on the context level. When the
# context is attached to the stack, this variable will be added to the stack's
# own environment. And that's how we do configuration reuse here at Spacelift.
# This evironment variable has its write_only bit explicitly set to false, which
# means that you'll be able to read back its valie from both the GUI and the API.

# You can read more about environment variables here:

# This is a secret environment variable. Note how we didn't set the write_only
# bit at all here. This setting always defaults to "true" to protect you against
# an accidental leak of secrets. There will be no way to retrieve the value of
# this variable programmatically, but it will be available to your Spacelift
# runs.
#
# If you accidentally print it out to the logs, no worries: we will obfuscate
# every secret thing we know of.

# Apart from setting environment variables in your Contexts, you can add files
# to be mounted directly in Spacelift's workspace. For the purpose of this
# experiment, let's export our environemnt variables as JSON-encoded files, too.
